tagline: Open source home automation platform for every use case
description: >-
     ioBroker is a powerful open source home automation platform that enables flexible integration and control of a huge variety of smart home devices and services. The system provides a modern web interface, supports hundreds of adapters and protocols, and is ideal for both beginners and power
     users.

     Once started, you can set up your devices and adapters via the web UI, create advanced automations, and shape your smart home exactly the way you want.

     All data remains on your server. ioBroker communicates with your devices locally on your network, or – if you wish – via supported cloud integrations. No mandatory cloud, no data harvesting!

     Note: USB adapters (such as Zigbee dongles) may require special configuration and may not be automatically detected when running Umbrel on a Raspberry Pi.
